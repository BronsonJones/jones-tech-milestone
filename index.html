<h1>Top 5 Tech Milestones</h1>
<h2>The Complex Number Calculator is completed (1940)</h2>
<hr width=300 align=left>
<p>The first ever computing relay was completed in 1937. This led to 
    the discovery that computers can easily learn to compute different numbers easily and without
    problem. When this was discovered, many computer scientists wanted to expand these relays into larger, 
    more complex computers. These bigger computers could very easily solve huge, complex multiplication and
    division problems. Despite the benefits, many would start to reject the idea of trying to build and 
    manufacture them due to the fact that the relays that would be used were incredibly expensive at the time. 
    When Bell Telephone Labs heard of this new advancement in computing, they were intrigued. 
    They needed a new way to solve their growing and complex mathematical problems. George Stibitz, 
    a researcher at Bell Labs, eventually finished the designs and they began production. In 1940, Stibitz 
    demonstrated the CNC at an American Mathematical Society conference. All calculations could be done remotely.</p>

<h2>Introduction of the IBM 650 Calculator (1954)</h2>
<hr width=300 align=left>
<p>Being possibly the first mass produced computer, IBM sold over 450 of them in just one 
    year. This model was incredibly popular with universities and their students. The IBM 
    650 was where the first ever generation of students were taught hot to program and code 
    computers and other machinery. The most probable reason that this specific model of 
    calculators was widely accepted and loved by the public was that it was easily the 
    fastest calculator at the time. It used a magnetic data-storage drum that spun at a 
    rate of over 12,500 rotations per minute.</p>
<br>
<h2>LaserDisc is Released (1978)</h2>
<hr width=300 align=left>
<p>The LaserDisc was one of the first forms of optic disc storage access that was first 
    sold in the 1970’s. It was labeled and marketed as “MCA Discovision” and was a 
    commercial home video format. Weighing in at a foot in diameter, the discs could hold 
    huge amounts of information. Inline with the size, the players needed to view these 
    discs were gigantic and expensive. On the other hand, the CD-ROM, which would be 
    released a few years later, required a much smaller, less expensive player, however, it 
    only held a fraction of the storage that these larger discs did. Due to this, the 
    LaserDiscs were only really only put in government and educational use.</p>
<br>
<h2>The Start of MySpace (2003)</h2>
<hr width=300 align=left>
<p>Despite not being the largest, or first, social networking site, MySpace was the most 
    trafficked website for many years. Friendster, an earlier social networking site, was 
    the basis for MySpace. The developers, Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson, wanted to add 
    more features and fix things that they thought would make the social network better. 
    They added features such as file storage, small video games, music playback, and much, 
    much, more. In 2005, the number of Myspace users grew to and above 100 million users. 
    However, it soon came to an end with the beginning of Facebook. MySpace paved the way for 
    the many, many different types of social media and networking sites that exist today.</p>
<br>
<h2>Angry Birds becomes the top-selling game (2010)</h2>
<hr width=300 align=left>
<p>While the use and marketing of touch-screen smartphones and tablets rose,
    many people were looking for pastimes that could be easily accessed with them.
    Angry Birds was were almost everyone found a happy place by either just slinging these 
    birds across the screen or actually trying to complete the whole story and all the levels
    with it. Angry Birds was THE game that started all mobile gaming.
